/**
 * The MeasureExecutor seam — the E9 (#78) architectural fork made concrete (ADR-025, advancing ADR-014 /
 * ADR-017). Measure execution is PLUGGABLE behind one port; the FHIR-native executor is the DEFAULT and the
 * correctness oracle, and a SQL-pushdown executor is a future, per-measure, PARITY-GATED opt-in.
 *
 *   - Option A (built, default): `fhirNativeExecutor` — adapt data into a FHIR bundle, evaluate with the
 *     existing JVM-free CQL→ELM engine. Full eCQM fidelity; the sole source of truth for `Outcome Status`
 *     (ADR-008). This is exactly the engine the run pipeline + ingress already use — a MeasureExecutor IS
 *     an `EvaluateMeasureBinding`, so it plugs into `evaluateBundle`'s `opts.engine` seam with no new
 *     plumbing and changes no outcome.
 *   - Option B (INERT stub, research-grade): `sqlPushdownExecutor` — run a measure as SQL inside WebChart's
 *     MariaDB ("run where the data lives"). NOT built: general CQL→SQL (interval/temporal algebra, FHIRPath,
 *     value-set expansion, 3-valued logic) does not map to portable SQL. It is inert-unless-built (mirrors
 *     the inert `webChartDataSource`): it constructs, but `evaluate` throws. Any future SQL executor must
 *     pass GOLDEN PARITY against the FHIR-native oracle, per measure, before it is allowed to serve.
 *   - Option C (this seam): the hybrid — one selection point, FHIR-native as default + oracle, SQL-pushdown
 *     as an opt-in per-measure path. `resolveMeasureExecutor(env)` mirrors resolveDataSource/resolveForecaster.
 *
 * Descriptive posture (ADR-008): the executor decides HOW a measure is computed, never that AI/heuristics
 * set compliance — CQL `Outcome Status` stays authoritative on every path. NO DB, NO node:fs here — this
 * stays portable across every @mieweb/cloud target.
