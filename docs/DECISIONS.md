# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Single Spring Boot deployable with modular package boundaries

- **Date:** 2026-04-29
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The internship timeline is 13 weeks with one primary developer path, and MVP success depends on shipping an end-to-end vertical slice early (author -> execute -> operate) with reliable local bring-up, fast CI, and minimal operational overhead.
- **Decision:** Use one Spring Boot deployable for backend runtime, organized by domain packages (`com.workwell.measure`, `com.workwell.compile`, `com.workwell.run`, `com.workwell.caseflow`, `com.workwell.audit`, `com.workwell.valueset`, `com.workwell.mcp`) rather than separate microservices during MVP.
- **Consequences:**
  - Faster Week 0-Week 3 delivery: one build, one process boundary, one deployment unit.
  - Simpler local development and debugging: fewer moving parts while CQL + FHIR integration is still being proven.
  - Clear seam for post-MVP split: package boundaries remain explicit so services can be carved out later if load or ownership requires it.
  - Keeps risk focus on measure correctness, run determinism, and case idempotency rather than distributed-systems overhead.

## ADR-002: evidence_json shape and define-level traceability

- **Date:** 2026-05-02
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** For "Explain Why Flagged", we need to decide whether to keep raw `evaluatedResource` evidence only, add explicit `rule_path[]`, or derive rule path automatically from CQL define results. D1 rechecked this against `../workwell-spike-cqf/` and Context7 docs for `cqf-fhir-cr`.
- **Decision:** Adopt the processor two-step composite flow as the canonical run pipeline:
  1. `R4MeasureProcessor.evaluateMeasureWithCqlEngine(...)` to compute `CompositeEvaluationResultsPerMeasure` (including define-level `expressionResults`).
  2. `R4MeasureProcessor.evaluateMeasure(..., compositeResults)` to materialize the standard `MeasureReport` from the same computed results.
- **Evidence from probe:**
  - `R4MeasureService.evaluate(...)` returns `MeasureReport` only; no define-result map is present on `MeasureReport`.
  - `R4MeasureProcessor.evaluateMeasureWithCqlEngine(...)` returns `CompositeEvaluationResultsPerMeasure` containing per-subject `EvaluationResult`.
  - `EvaluationResult.expressionResults` contains define-name/value pairs (probe output included `Denominator`, `Initial Population`, `Numerator` with boolean values).
  - Dual-evaluation cost probe (2026-05-01): `serviceEvaluateMs=5` vs composite flow `combinedMs=2` (`engineEvalMs=2`, `reportBuildFromCompositeMs=0`), so the composite path is a cheaper primary path, not a workaround.
- **Consequences:**
  - `evidence_json` shape is now structured as `{ expressionResults: {...}, evaluatedResource: [...] }`.
  - `rule_path[]` is derived at render time from CQL define names + `expressionResults`; it is not persisted as a stored field.
  - "Why Flagged" UI is structured-first: render `expressionResults` deterministically as the base case; AI natural-language wrapping is optional polish.
  - Outstanding Week 5 confirmation: run this same composite flow against the JPA-backed repository path. Expected yes, not yet tested in this exact combination.
